Join us Monday, the 26th of May, for "From Honeypot to Discovery: Forensic Analysis with Dissect".
The presentation will show you how we use [Dissect](https://github.com/fox-it/dissect), an open-source tool, to investigate the content of a potentially infected `qcow2` disk image.
Then, we'll talk about how we integrate and automate the analysis of the `qcow2` snapshot images generated by our [cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)-based SSH honeypot.

Don't miss out, we have juicy threat intelligence stuff as well (but only for your eyes)! Register [here](https://indico.upb.ro/event/5/) and we'll send you an invite!
