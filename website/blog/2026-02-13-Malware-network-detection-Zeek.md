Join us Monday, the 23rd of February, for "Malicious network activity detection with Zeek".
The presentation will show you how we use [Zeek](https://zeek.org/), an open-source tool, to monitor the network activity of the sites that are publicly exposed to the Internet.
We will show the infrastructure we deployed and the integrations we have made for Zeek to detect malicious traffic.

As threat intelligence sources, we use [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [FireHOL](https://iplists.firehol.org/) and some in-house developed scripts.


Don't miss out, we have juicy threat intelligence stuff as well (but only for your eyes)! Register on [indico.upb.ro](https://indico.upb.ro/event/6/) and we'll send you an invite!
