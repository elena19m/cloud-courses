# Container-based virtualization

We will be using a virtual machine in the [faculty's cloud](http://cloud.grid.pub.ro/).

When creating a virtual machine in the Launch Instance window:
  * Name your VM using the following convention: `scgc_lab<no>_<username>`,
where `<no>` is the lab number and `<username>` is your institutional account.
  * Select **Boot from image** in **Instance Boot Source** section
  * Select **SCGC Template** in **Image Name** section
  * Select the **m1.large** flavor.

In the base virtual machine:
  * Download the laboratory archive from [here](https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/scgc/laboratoare/lab-docker.zip) in the `work` directory.
Use: `wget https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/scgc/laboratoare/lab-docker.zip` to download the archive.
  * Extract the archive.
  * Download the `runvm.sh` script.
The `.qcow2` files will be used to start virtual machines using the `runvm.sh` script.
  * Start the virtual machines using `bash runvm.sh`.
  * The username for connecting to the nested VMs is `student` and the password is `student`.


```shell-session
$ # change the working dir
$ cd ~/work
$ # download the archive
$ wget https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/scgc/laboratoare/lab-docker.zip
$ unzip lab-docker.zip
$ # start VMs; it may take a while
$ bash runvm.sh
$ # check if the VMs booted
$ virsh net-dhcp-leases labvms
```
