# CI/CD

## Setup

We will be using a virtual machine in the [faculty's cloud](http://cloud.grid.pub.ro/).

When creating a virtual machine in the Launch Instance window:
  * Name your VM using the following convention: `cc_lab<no>_<username>`,
where `<no>` is the lab number and `<username>` is your institutional account.
  * Select **Boot from image** in **Instance Boot Source** section
  * Select **CC Template** in **Image Name** section
  * Select the **g.medium** flavor.

## Before we start

:::info
If you do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, create one before starting this laboratory. It will be used to interact with a repository and create the CI/CD pipeline in it.
