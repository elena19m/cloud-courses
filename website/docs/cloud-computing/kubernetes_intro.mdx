# Kubernetes (Part 1)

## Setup

We will be using a virtual machine in the [faculty's cloud](http://cloud.grid.pub.ro/).

When creating a virtual machine in the Launch Instance window:
  * Name your VM using the following convention: `cc_lab<no>_<username>`,
where `<no>` is the lab number and `<username>` is your institutional account.
  * Select **Boot from image** in **Instance Boot Source** section
  * Select **CC Template** in **Image Name** section
  * Select the **g.medium** flavor.

## Exposing an app

Even if `hello-app` is deployed, there is currently no way of communicating with it from outside the cluster.
The only way would be to use `kubectl exec` to enter the pod and communicate via localhost, which is not convenient.

For exposing the app outside the cluster, we need to create a Kubernetes **service**. This will act like a port-forwarding rule.

### Creating a service

We can create a service using `kubectl expose` or using a manifest. We will choose the second option.

Let's define a service manifest and apply it:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ cat hello-app-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-app
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: hello
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30080

student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl apply -f hello-app-service.yaml
service/hello-app created

student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
hello-app    NodePort    10.96.186.102   <none>        8080:30080/TCP   7m42s
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          20h
```

:::note
There are multiple attributes that describe ports:
  * `targetPort` is the port that the pod listens to
  * `port` is the port that other pods from **within** the cluster can connect to the service
  * `nodePort` is the port that we can connect to from **outside** the cluster (must be between 30000-32767)
:::

### Connecting to a service

Before connecting to the service, we must determine the node's IP address:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl describe nodes kind-control-plane | grep InternalIP
  InternalIP:  172.18.0.2
```

and then connect via `curl`:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ curl http://172.18.0.2:30080
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: hello-app-599bb4bf7f-l45k4
```

## Upgrades and rollbacks

Deploying a different image version is done via editing the manifest and modifying the `image` field.

### Upgrading an app

Update `hello-app-deployment.yaml` and change the image tag to `2.0`. Then, redeploy the manifest:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl apply -f hello-app-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/hello-app configured
```

To follow the status of the update, use `kubectl rollout status`:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl rollout status deployment hello-app
Waiting for deployment "hello-app" rollout to finish: 5 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
[...]
deployment "hello-app" successfully rolled out
```

Run a `curl` to confirm that the upgraded application is running:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ curl http://172.18.0.2:30080
Hello, world!
Version: 2.0.0
Hostname: hello-app-56c5b6c78b-74x9s
```

### Rolling back

After the upgrade, a new replica set (more on this in the next lab) was created, and the old replica set was scaled down to `0`:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl get replicasets
NAME                   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
hello-app-56c5b6c78b   1         1         1       5m55s
hello-app-599bb4bf7f   0         0         0       60m
```

For quickly reverting to the previous version (for example, in case of an error), we can use `kubectl rollout undo`:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ kubectl rollout undo deployment hello-app
deployment.apps/hello-app rolled back
```

Confirm that the rollback was successful:

```shell-session
student@lab-kubernetes:~$ curl http://172.18.0.2:30080
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: hello-app-599bb4bf7f-fcsf2
```
